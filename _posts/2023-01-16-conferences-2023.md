title: "CS Conferences in 2023"
categories:
---

I put together a preliminary list of conferences on my "watch list" for 2023. It doesn't cover everything and I would love suggestions via email (email address is my name at gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micahlerner).

I've added a few new conferences to the list [from 2022](https://www.micahlerner.com/2021/12/30/conferences-2022.html). The new conferences are mostly related to bioinformatics/biotech - I want to branch out and read more papers not from "my area" of computer science.

I also certainly won't be able to read every paper from the conferences below, but I will try to keep with a regular posting schedule like the one I had in 2022!
