With a few days left in 2021, I found some time to put together a list of conferences on my "watch list" for next year. I certainly won't be able to read every paper from the conferences below, but I will try to keep with a regular posting schedule like the one I had in 2021.

I've also added a few new conferences to the list [from 2021](/2021/08/14/systems-conferences-2021.html). The new conferences are mostly related to machine learning, programming languages, and cryptography - I want to branch out and read more papers not from "my area" of computer science.
