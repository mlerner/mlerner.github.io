<h2 id="what-is-the-research-and-why-does-it-matter">What is the research and why does it matter?</h2>

<p>Many tech companies have distributed services deployed in the cloud in regions around the world. They systems often depend on each other, meaning that they need to determine which dependencies are where (service discovery), and route the requests across the network (often performed via a “service mesh”). Inter-system communication also needs to be highly reliable and load balanced.</p>

<p>This paper is about Meta’s infrastructure that implements these capabilities, called ServiceRouter.</p>

<p>While there are well known open source systems for routing traffic (e.g. <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and <a href="https://istio.io/latest/about/service-mesh/">Istio</a>), there are a few interesting components of ServiceRouter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ServiceRouter can be embedded inside Meta application code, significantly reducing cost from the common pattern of running separate “service mesh” infrastructure - the paper suggests that a separately deployed service mesh at Meta scale would need the equivalent of <a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/?selected=t4g.small">1,750,000 AWS t4g.small VMs</a>.</li>
  <li>ServiceRouter of the first pieces of routing infrastructure discussed in research deployed at hyperscale.</li>
  <li>ServiceRouter is able to handle sharded stateful services, unlike open source alternatives.</li>
  <li>The technology handles load balancing across regions using the novel idea of “Latency Rings”.</li>
</ul>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure1.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="how-does-the-system-work">How does the system work?</h2>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>There are three main functions of ServiceRouter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gathering the data that informs how services talk to each other.</li>
  <li>Distributing that data reliably around the network.</li>
  <li>Routing a request from a service to another service.</li>
</ul>

<p>To build a source of truth for routing decisions (which the paper calls the <em>Routing Information Base (RIB)</em>), ServiceRouter gathers information from the cluster manager about which services are running where.  Importantly, ServiceRouter can also handle stateful services (discussed in my previous paper review on <a href="https://www.micahlerner.com/2022/01/08/shard-manager-a-generic-shard-management-framework-for-geo-distributed-applications.html">ShardManager</a>) - for example, some stateful services will store a specific subset of data on a specific server, so knowing the server alone is not enough.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure6.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>ServiceRouter also gathers information that allows it to make decisions about how services talk to each other across clusters (for example, monitoring the latency of traffic from North America to South America). Using these inputs, Service Router’s control layer produces a dataset it calls the <em>Routing Information Base</em>.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure7.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>ServiceRouter then distributes the <em>Routing Information Base</em> across infrastructure in the network to allow them to make routing decisions.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure2.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>To implement the part of the system responsible for making routing decisions, ServiceRouter supports three main types of deployments: SRLib, Remote Proxy, and Sidecar Proxy (the paper also mentions a fourth, SRLookaside which is now deprecated).</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure4.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/table2.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p><em>SRLib</em> embeds the ServiceRouter functionality actually inside the application binary, deeply integrated with application source code. While this introduces some risk (e.g. if the embedded library had a bug or vulnerability, all applications would need to be re-released), it dramatically reduces hardware cost.</p>

<p>There are several situations in which SRLib performs suboptimally - for example, with traffic that goes across regions, it is preferable to have a smaller set of proxies that perform the RPC forwarding using long-held connections, lowering the overhead of sending RPCs.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure5.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>ServiceRouter also supports codebases where it is difficult or impossible to embed SRLib directly. The paper cites one example of internal Erlang applications which didn’t have builtin support for the library, but still wanted to make use of Meta-internal systems.</p>

<h3 id="load-balancing">Load Balancing</h3>

<p>One of the most novel features of ServiceRouter is its approach to global load balancing traffic across regions.</p>

<p>The system implements this capability using the idea of <em>locality rings</em> for a service:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>An RPC client uses cross-region RTTs to estimate its latency to different servers. Starting from ring1, if the client finds any RPC server whose latency is within the latency bound for ring i, it filters out all servers in ring i+1 and above, and randomly samples two servers from ring i. If the service has no servers in ring i, it considers servers in ring i+1, and so forth. SR’s default setting maps [ring1</td>
        <td>ring2</td>
        <td>ring3</td>
        <td>ring4] to [same region</td>
        <td>neighboring regions</td>
        <td>same continent</td>
        <td>global].</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper discusses several downsides to this approach, notably that latency alone doesn’t reflect how servers in a <em>locality ring</em> are being utilized. To solve this shortcoming, ServiceRouter integrates another input to the Routing Information Base - the load of a “locality ring”. This data allows ServiceRouter to support functionality like “route X% of traffic to this locality ring until the load of that locality ring exceeds X%, then send traffic to the next locality ring.”</p>

<p>The paper also discusses alternatives to the locality ring approach, including relying solely on RPC latency and feedback from a service about overload to decide when to send traffic to a different locality ring - the authors decided not to follow this approach as they argue that routing would change only under severe overload.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-the-research-evaluated">How is the research evaluated?</h2>

<p>The paper evaluates ServiceRouter on four main aspects: its scalability, the cost-savings of an embedded routing library, performance of global load balancing, and ability to handle sharded services.</p>

<p>To assess scalability, the paper shares data on the number of servers used by services and the requests per second by service:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A small fraction of services are very large while most are very small. Specifically, while 90% of services each use less than 200 servers, 2% of services each use more than 2,000 servers and the largest service uses about 90ć servers…Similarly, while most services have a low RPS, some hyperscale services process billions of RPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure8.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>
<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure9.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>The paper also discusses several scalability challenges, specifically with the <em>Routing Information Base</em>, which must store data on Meta’s ever-changing services and production infrastructure. Interestingly, the authors say that the RIB is not currently a bottleneck, following their work to migrate off of <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Zookeeper</a> and onto a custom datastore.</p>

<p>To evaluate hardware cost, the paper compares RPC latency and CPU overhead for Meta’s raw RPC library (called Thrift), embedded SRLib and the SRProxy - “across the RPC client and proxy, the SRProxy setup in total consumes more than twice the amount of CPU cycles as the SRLib setup”.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure10.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>The paper also includes several production use cases of SRProxy. One example was for a shareded system that sends traffic cross-region. SRProxy was able to reduce cross-region latency because it reuses connections. Because ServiceRouter was able to effectively support cross-region load balancing, the system didn’t need to replicate all the shards to all the regions, significantly reducing capacity usage.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure11.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>To evaluate load balancing, the paper considers the permutations of same-region and cross-region load balancing for both sharded and unsharded services. For same region traffic of unsharded services, load balancing is quite good, represented with a low “coefficient of variation” for CPU usage and outstanding requests. The story for sharded services is more complicated due to inherent shard imbalance - “some shards are hot (receiving a lot of traffic) while others are cold (receiving little traffic), due to the nature of data stored in the shards.” In other words, even if ServiceRouter load balances performs perfectly, there will always be some variation of load between shards.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure12.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>To evaluate global load balancing with locality rings, the paper includes an example of an incident where traffic spilled cross-region, and SR was able to balance load below the 75% locality threshold.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure13.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<p>Lastly, the paper shows that traffic to sharded makes up a significant portion of total traffic, highlighting the requirement that this nuance needs to be supported in Meta’s service mesh.</p>

<figure><img class="maincolumn-img" src="/assets/sr/figure14.png" /><figcaption class="maincolumn-figure"></figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While service meshes aren’t necessarily novel, ServiceRouter’s deployment at scale, along with its implementation of global load balancing and support for sharded services are unique. In a followup paper review, I’m planning on comparing ServiceRouter and its discussion of sharded services with Google’s paper from 2016 on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-adya.pdf">Slicer</a>.</p>

<p>Load balancing cross region at scale, in particular to handle reliability issues, is non-trivial. I’d be interested in hearing more about how teams formulate locality rings (as from the paper, it seems like some custom tuning is involved). Furthermore, the ideas behind locality rings seems ripe for further development - are latency and CPU usage the only factors that locality rings should be limited to? Relying only on those two metrics seems like it could breakdown during an incident (e.g. if a region was serving many errors, its CPU utilization might look lower, meaning that ServiceRouter would send requests there, potentially overloading it).</p>

<p>Lastly, embedding SRLib in an application’s code saves resources, but seems like it would introduce risk. For example, if SRLib had a fleet-wide security vulnerability or performance regression that couldn’t be turned off, what would the impact to services and developers be?</p>
