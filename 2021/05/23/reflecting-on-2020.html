  <section id="post-content">
       <p>I’m publishing my year in review for 2020 in (almost) June 2021, although it was mostly written (and just in the backburner state) as I spun up in a new role.</p>

<p>2020 was quite a year. In early 2020 I had taken time off for work and was bug bounty hunting for fun and profit. Taking time off from work meant that I also spent significant time reading the news (moreso than a full-time-employed version of myself would). As a result, I felt like I saw the coronavirus coming to the US in slow motion, then all at once.</p>

<p>Post March 2020, life changed significantly in many ways. My partner came home from law school for Spring Break, and never went back <label for="law" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="law" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">She graduated! </span>. Great things happened - we moved in together and got engaged in early 2021!</p>

<p>Workwise, I started a new role at Mapbox in the first few weeks of the Bay Area’s stay at home orders. It could have been extremely stressful, but I think Mapbox’s culture was uniquely suited to enabling the onboarding to happen as smoothly as it did. Over a year later in early 2021 (while I was having a great time working at Mapbox), a Google recruiter reached out about a dream job on the SRE team. That call led to interviews and an offer - now I am amazingly on the Google Geo SRE team! <label for="What is an SRE?" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="What is an SRE?" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I will leave it to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/">the SRE book</a> to describe what my role entails: “SRE is what you get when you treat operations as if it’s a software problem. Our mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of Google’s public services — Google Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and App Engine, to name just a few — with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity.” </span></p>

<p>In other words, much happened (which brings me back to the traditional section of a year-in-review).</p>

<h3 id="what-didnt-go-well">What didn’t go well</h3>

<p>Much of what I envisioned with respect to goals in my <a href="/yearly/review/2020/03/01/looking-ahead-in-2020.html">last yearly review</a> had to be tossed out the window.</p>

<p>I’m not too hard on myself for not achieving every goal I set for myself in 2020. Goal setting is an important (and useful) exercise in and of itself, and I am of the school of thought that achieving 100% of one’s goals means that the goals were not lofty enough!</p>

<p>That said, I am resolving to make the learning goals I set in the future more focused and measurable than they have been in the past. <label for="goals" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="goals" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Other life goals not featured here. :) </span></p>

<h3 id="what-went-well">What went well</h3>

<p>I did achieve certain learning goals, even in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning Mandarin:</strong> I kept to my goal of learning Mandarin every day! While I have stayed with daily usage of Duolingo, I dropped other apps I was using to learn the language. My plan to attend a Mandarin course obviously didn’t happen (how “early March 2020” of me to make that goal), I started working with a teacher on Italki - it is an amazing site for language learners, where one can connect with professional teachers who are running their own teaching businesses. Having a teacher was an amazing inflection point for my language learning. I currently meet with him for about three hours every week.</li>
  <li><strong>Writing</strong>: I wrote significantly more (around +50%) in 2020 than I did in 2019, and I’m calling that a win. Some of my writing even made it to the top of Hacker News, which was fun to see. I want to keep writing about what I’m passionate about, and work on trying to find my audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning about systems</strong>: In the fall of 2020, I started a Master’s degree at Georgia Tech. I initially was planning on focusing in ML, but I started out taking Systems courses. This led to a pivot when I realized that I actually prefer Systems - the skillset is enjoyable to me, and will likely always be useful (thus building a wider foundation in it is more valuable). This is in contrast to ML knowledge, which is subject to change in the very near future. <label for="Max" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="Max" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Thank you to my friend Max for your thoughts! </span>
<label for="" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.shreya-shankar.com/systems/">Related article</a> on the usefulness of studying systems </span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="looking-ahead-to-the-rest-of-2021">Looking ahead to (the rest of) 2021</h3>

<p>In a previous edition of my yearly reflections, I wrote that I thought learning shouldn’t be bound by goals because “learning isn’t work”. I have since changed my tune on this. In fact, I think that in this distracted world, having goals for learning that you have written up on the wall can be helpful for focusing oneself (in particular, myself)</p>

<p>On that note, I have made a few goals for myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning Mandarin</strong>. Mandarin is such an interesting language - each character has a story, and it is fun to see how words I already known can be combined together to form new words (旧字新字).
    <ul>
      <li>Keep learning with the goal of passing the HSK4 test by March of 2022. HSK4 is a milestone that students who have studied Chinese for two academic years study for. <label for="HSK4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="HSK4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I would be at about 1.5 years by then, but it never hurts to be ahead of schedule </span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Writing and the blog</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Build an audience of 1000 subscribers for my blog. Why 1000? 100 seems too achievable, and 1000 subscribers would be pretty serious (considering that I only got 20 subscribers from being on the front page of Hacker News)! Building an audience for the blog also means that I am writing about topics that others find interesting, and doing so in a fashion that is good enough to be warrant showing up in someone’s inbox.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Systems</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Read at least one systems paper a week from distributed systems and write an <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes">evergreen note</a> about it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Computer Security</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Find one or more security vulnerabilities in an Ethereum contract. I’ve been interested in Ethereum for a while, but trying to find a security vulnerability in a contract will require deeper understanding of both the platform and the newer innovations on it (like the various DeFi protocols).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
