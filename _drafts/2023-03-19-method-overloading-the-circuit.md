[Method Overloading the Circuit](TODO)

## What is the research?

Circuit breakers are a pattern in microservice architectures (TODO cite) used to shut off requests to failing dependencies. The pattern allows a system to handle partial failure, and is used across industry to prevent common breakages (like cascading failures) while improving system reliability.

In "Method Overloading the Circuit," the authors discuss challenges with current designs, and detail their tradeoffs. In particular, they focus on  hiding implementation details of circuit breakers from implementers, and the sensitivity of the technique in response to errors.

## What are the paper's contributions?

The paper makes two main contributions:

- Providing an overview of current circuit breaker designs and their challenges
-

## How does the system work?

## How is the research evaluated?

## Conclusion
